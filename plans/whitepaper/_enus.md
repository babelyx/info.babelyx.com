Come on, create freely, monetize your content, and unleash more possibilities for everyone!

### Origins

Babelyx builds the Tower of Babel with user content, a library of endless possibilities, the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds of the multiverse.

In the Bible's Book of Genesis, God created the world and humanity, with people scattering across the earth to prosper. One day, ancient humans decided to build a "Tower of Babel." At that time, everyone spoke the same language and pursued a common goal, gradually erecting a tower that soared into the clouds. When the tower was about to reach the heavens, God became fearful and confused human language, rendering people unable to understand each other. Strife ensued, and the tower was ultimately abandoned and crumbled into ruins.

In 1941, Argentine writer Julio Cosset introduced a marvelous concept in his work "The Library of Babel." The Library of Babel is a simple, infinite library that contains every possible combination of characters. In this library, no matter where one stands, all around are endlessly extending walls of books composed of countless hexagonal shelves. Every two adjacent books differ by only a single letter. Yet with such minute differences, if you traverse the shelves long enough and take enough turns, you are bound to find any book you desire. Within this boundless library exist all possible combinations of languages, topics, and meanings‚Äîincluding every possibility of the past, present, and future‚Äîeverything exists, waiting to be discovered.

Eastern Buddhist philosophy also introduces the concept of the "Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds," depicting a cosmic structure from the macrocosm to the microcosm. The "Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds" consist of innumerable great worlds (MahƒÅsaha-loka), each comprising countless middle worlds (Madhya-loka) where the six realms of rebirth exist. Furthermore, every middle world contains numerous minor worlds (Saha-loka), each with its own heavens, earths, sentient beings, and myriad forms of existence, characterized by unique life, landscapes, and laws. This concept illustrates the infinite vastness and diversity of the universe, suggesting that countless worlds of all sizes‚Äîwith distinct qualities and modes of existence‚Äîawait discovery.

Babelyx realizes more possibilities for you.

### Why Babelyx?

We all know that the content you publish online doesn‚Äôt truly belong to you; it is controlled by centralized social media platforms. Your earnings are not directly derived from your content, but rather through first acquiring sufficient traffic, which then enables sales, affiliate marketing, advertising, and other commercial actions, with the platform distributing revenue shares. All of this depends entirely on the centralized control of traffic. Content censorship, monitoring, and bans can occur on a whim by platform operators.

This is precisely why Web3 emerged. Since the rise of NFT technology in 2021, it has been celebrated for turning digital content into unique assets and establishing direct, close connections among creators, fans, supporters, and investors.

However, NFT ownership is currently based on ‚Äúinsecure data.‚Äù Although NFTs themselves, secured by blockchain technology, are irreplicable and tamper-proof, the digital content they reference remains as vulnerable as on traditional Web2 platforms, where anyone can freely view, download, copy, or even alter it. This limitation has confined NFT technology mostly to the digital art realm. Moreover, the high technical threshold of NFTs and Web3 significantly hinders the user experience of ordinary users, preventing broader adoption.

Can these issues be resolved so that digital content becomes a tangible product, generating continuous revenue and offering everyone even more possibilities?

Yes! To make more possibilities a reality for everyone, we have uniquely built the Babelyx platform.

### What Does Babelyx?

Babelyx encrypts any user content into sovereign assets that automatically circulate and appreciate in an intelligent market, continuously boosting the returns for all participants.

As a user, you can publish content‚Äîimages, text, videos, and more‚Äîjust like on any social media platform. The difference is that every creative act on Babelyx is encrypted into a phygital asset that always belongs to you and remains unbreakable.

Even more intriguingly, on Babelyx, your content asset is packaged by a smart contract into an automated vending machine‚Äîmuch like a storefront within an e-commerce platform. Other users must pay to access or use your content, ensuring 24/7 autonomous trading that delivers continuous income!

### Features and Implementations

This is facilitated by our patented BLX technology that seamlessly integrates data security of IPFS, digital ownership of NFTs, and smart contracts of Ethereum, along with powerful AIGC technologies, providing you with an unprecedented experience, rights and rewards.

Babelyx features:

##### Sovereign Asset

User-generated content is transformed into Sovereign Content Assets by following steps:

1. At first the actual content is stored in the decentralized content-addressing system IPFS;
2. Then, hash addresses of the content and their stakeholders are encrypted into a "**Sovereign Content Certificate**" and stored in IPFS;
3. Finally, the certificate pointing to the encrypted content is minted into a "**Sovereign Content Token**" on a blockchain, also known as "Safe NFT" that ensurs not only the safe ownership, but also the safe content, constituting an inseparable whole.

User Content ==> Sovereign Content Certificate in IPFS ==> Sovereign Content Token (Safe NFT) on Blockchain

Through these steps, while the certificate and token remains public, the actual content is fundamentally prevented from unauthorized access, copying, distribution, and tampering. For instance, others must pay a decryption fee to the content owner, to be able to access the actual content through a decentralized mechanism.

Therefore, the sovereign asset not only ensure your ownership, but also goes further to unbreakably safeguard your data privacy and security by means of mathematical principles!

##### Smart Market

Babelyx not only transforms user content into a static sovereign asset but also generates a self-running store, thereby creating a smart marketplace. This is powered by Role Pacts that are stored as part of the sovereign content certificates. Role pacts are smart contracts defining rights and benefits of different market roles. Through Role Pacts, the underlying asset can circulate and appreciate automatically among various participant roles, perpetually increasing every participant's revenue. For example:

- **Creator Pact** is an intrinsic part of the sovereign content asset. Once some piece of content is transformed into an asset, the content creator becomes an indelible, unalterable and permanent property of the sovereign content. In all subsequent appreciation of this asset, the original creator will automatically receive corresponding returns according to the Creator Pact.
- **Visitor Pact** defines a decryption fee for visitors. Other user must pay the decryption fee to be able to visit the original content. Anyone else cannot decrypt the asset to see, copy or download the actual content. If the creator does't set a decription fee, it's default to 0, henceforce the content is open to public just like in a traditional UGC platform.
- **Holder Pact** defines a purchase fee for buyers. A user who pays the purchase fee becomes a "holder" of a certain share of the asset. Holding rights apply to limited-supply shareable assets such as book copies, movie tickets, membership statuses, restaurant seats, rental time slots, etc. Users can transfer their limited slots at new prices to other holders, promoting sharing, circulation, and appreciation.
- **Owner Pact** keeps track of the current owner of the asset and the buyout price for full ownership. Other users can acquire the asset by purchasing it outright, becoming the new owner. Each asset can only belong to one owner at any given time. The majority of the asset's revenue is enjoyed by its current owner.
- More pacts: Beyond these roles, assets can have more detailed or extended roles such as agents, operators, renters, and more, just like in the real-world.

Thus, Role Pacts transforms user content to a perpetual self-running store supporting the asset to circulate and appreciate among different market roles automatically, providing long-term revenue for all stakeholders and maintaining high enthusiasm for various user types.

##### Passive Income

Babelyx devotes itself to a world where users reign supreme! Let data return to individuals, let rights and incomes return to the true owner. Break through centralized traffic-centric economy of the traditional internet and usher in a decentralized economy centered on individual rights.
