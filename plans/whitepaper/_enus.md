### Origins

Babelyx is everyone‚Äôs Tower of Babel, a library brimming with endless possibilities, the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds of the multiverse.

In the Bible's Book of Genesis, God created the world and humanity, with people scattering across the earth to prosper. One day, ancient humans decided to build a "Tower of Babel." At that time, everyone spoke the same language and pursued a common goal, gradually erecting a tower that soared into the clouds. When the tower was about to reach the heavens, God became fearful and confused human language, rendering people unable to understand each other. Strife ensued, and the tower was ultimately abandoned and crumbled into ruins.

In 1941, Argentine writer Julio Cosset introduced a marvelous concept in his work "The Library of Babel." The Library of Babel is a simple, infinite library that contains every possible combination of characters. In this library, no matter where one stands, all around are endlessly extending walls of books composed of countless hexagonal shelves. Every two adjacent books differ by only a single letter. Yet with such minute differences, if you traverse the shelves long enough and take enough turns, you are bound to find any book you desire. Within this boundless library exist all possible combinations of languages, topics, and meanings‚Äîincluding every possibility of the past, present, and future‚Äîeverything exists, waiting to be discovered.

Eastern Buddhist philosophy also introduces the concept of the "Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds," depicting a cosmic structure from the macrocosm to the microcosm. The "Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds" consist of innumerable great worlds (MahƒÅsaha-loka), each comprising countless middle worlds (Madhya-loka) where the six realms of rebirth exist. Furthermore, every middle world contains numerous minor worlds (Saha-loka), each with its own heavens, earths, sentient beings, and myriad forms of existence, characterized by unique life, landscapes, and laws. This concept illustrates the infinite vastness and diversity of the universe, suggesting that countless worlds of all sizes‚Äîwith distinct qualities and modes of existence‚Äîawait discovery.

Babelyx ‚Äì minting, safeguarding, and realizing every possibility for you.

### Why Babelyx?

We all know that the content you publish online doesn‚Äôt truly belong to you; it is controlled by centralized social media platforms. Your earnings are not directly derived from your content, but rather through first acquiring sufficient traffic, which then enables sales, affiliate marketing, advertising, and other commercial actions, with the platform distributing revenue shares. All of this depends entirely on the centralized control of traffic. Content censorship, monitoring, and bans can occur on a whim by platform operators.

This is precisely why Web3 emerged. Since the rise of NFT technology in 2021, it has been celebrated for turning digital content into unique assets and establishing direct, close connections among creators, fans, supporters, and investors.

However, NFT ownership is currently based on ‚Äúinsecure data.‚Äù Although NFTs themselves, secured by blockchain technology, are irreplicable and tamper-proof, the digital content they reference remains as vulnerable as on traditional Web2 platforms, where anyone can freely view, download, copy, or even alter it. This limitation has confined NFT technology mostly to the digital art realm. Moreover, the high technical threshold of NFTs and Web3 significantly hinders the user experience of ordinary users, preventing broader adoption.

Can these issues be resolved so that digital content becomes a tangible product, generating continuous revenue and offering everyone even more possibilities?

Yes! To make more possibilities a reality for everyone, we have uniquely built the Babelyx platform.
