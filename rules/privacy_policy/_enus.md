Depending on location, individuals in the EEA, the UK, and across the globe may have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Information. For example, you may have the right to:

Access your Personal Information.
Delete your Personal Information.
Correct or update your Personal Information.
Transfer your Personal Information elsewhere.
Withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Information where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing.
Object to or restrict the processing of your Personal Information where we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing.
You can exercise some of these rights through your Babelyx account. If you are unable to exercise your rights through your account, please send your request to hi@babelyx.com.

A note about accuracy: Services like Babelyx generate responses by reading a user‚Äôs request and then predicting the next most likely words that might appear in response. In some cases, the most likely next words may not be the most factually accurate ones. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that Babelyx output contains factually inaccurate personal information about you and you would like us to correct the inaccuracy, you may submit a correction request to hi@babelyx.com. Given the technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to correct the inaccuracy. In that case, you may request that we remove your personal information from Babely‚Äôs output by sending email to hi@babelyx.com.

For information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see this help center article.

8. Security and Retention
   We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect Personal Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

In addition, we are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service, or third party websites.

We‚Äôll retain your Personal Information for only as long as we need in order to provide our Service to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Information will depend on a number of factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, our purpose for processing the information, and any legal requirements.

We may also anonymize or de-identify your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, as described above, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
