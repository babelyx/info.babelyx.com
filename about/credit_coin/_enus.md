On the Babelyx platform, all content and transactions are based on Babel Coin (BAB).

### Original Issuance Period

During the original issuance period, each BAB is priced at $0.01.

In this period, each registered user who logs in once a day can receive 100 BAB for free, equivalent to $1.

- Thanks to the free distribution of Babel Coin, new users can start creating, sharing, and trading content immediately without any investment.

In addition to the free airdrop, users can also purchase Babel Coin (BAB) at the price of $0.01 each to meet their needs for viewing or collecting works.

A total of 1 billion BAB will be issued during the original issuance period, including free airdrops and user purchases. Once 1 billion coins are issued, the original issuance period will automatically end.

- Assuming there are 10,000 registered users, each receiving 100 BAB daily, a total of 365,000,000 BAB will be distributed for free in one year (10,000 x 100 x 365). It will take approximately 3 years to reach 1 billion, thus ending the original issuance period.
- However, the actual ending time may vary significantly based on the number of users and their purchase amounts.

### Daily Operations Period

After the original issuance period ends, the daily operations period begins.

The total amount of circulating Babel Coins corresponds to the value of all content on the Babel platform. As high-value content accumulates, the total assets of Babel continue to grow. If the total amount of Babel Coin remains constant, the richer the content, the higher the unit value of BAB, allowing users to access more high-quality content. Therefore, even if you do not create anything, you can still benefit from the growth of Babel's content and the appreciation of Babel Coin (BAB).

During the daily operations period, the total amount of Babel Coin (BAB) will maintain a slow, natural growth. Growth avenues include:

- Users can purchase Babel Coin (BAB) on their own, with prices determined by the market. As content on the Babel platform increases, the value of BAB is expected to show a stable growth trend. The platform will dynamically, automatically, and transparently adjust prices based on current market supply and demand.
- The platform will reserve 1 billion BAB for various operational activities, which will be distributed periodically to incentivize outstanding works and users.
