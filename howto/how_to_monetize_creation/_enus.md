In Babelyx, every content artifact will become an automated vending machine, automatically circulating and appreciating in value on the smart market according to the transaction contracts you set, earning you a continuous and long-term income!

For example, you can set these contracts after that you have submitted the content of an artifact:

### Decryptor Contract

You set a decryption fee for the creation.

The content of every artifact is sealed using Bitcoin's encryption algorithms. Other users must pay you a decryption fee to unlock the seal and view the content.

For example, if you've taken a brilliant photo or written an insightful market analysis report, you can set the decryption fee to 2 coin. Whenever another user pays to decrypt your creation, you will receive 2 coin in your account.

You can also set the contract to be "Disallowed" in which case this artifact will only be visible to you and can be used to store your private personal information.

If you don't make a setting, the default decryption fee is 0, meaning your artifact will be publicly available for free to everyone, just like on traditional social media. For example, you can publicly post your daily life records and interact with other users.

### Holder Contract

You set a stock quantity and a unit price for the creation.

Depending on the inherent nature of the content, an artifact can be distributed as multiple copies, seats, shares, etc. Other users can pay you to purchase, hold and use a copy of your artifact.

For example, if you've created an oil painting and want to release a batch of limited-edition copies to your fans to promote your personal brand, prevent unauthorized use, and control market prices. You can set the stock quantity to 100 and a special price of 88 coin. After your fans purchase it, they will receive a limited-edition oil painting copy with a unique serial number. In the future, your fans can also resell it on the market, thereby sharing in the appreciation of your work's value.

For example, if your work is actually a newly launched ice cream, and you want to distribute a batch of coupons to promote user interaction and expand influence. You can set the stock quantity to 1000 and a special price of 1 coin. A user who spends 1 coin to buy a coupon can then go to the store and enjoy an ice cream actually valued at 10 coin.

If you don't make a setting, it defaults to be "Disallowed" and other users cannot purchase and hold your work.

### Worker Contract

You set an agency fee and a profit-sharing ratio for the creation.

You can entrust an artifact and its future earnings to professionals. When a buyer signs the contract and makes the payment, they become a collaborator for this creation, able to participate in or fully manage its operation. You and the collaborator will share all subsequent profits according to a set ratio.

For example, if you are an artisan who focuses on creation and lacks the time and channels to connect with a large customer base. You set an agenct fee of 10,000 coin for an artifact and a corresponding profit-sharing ratio of 70%. If a user is optimistic about your artifact's market prospects, they can pay you 10,000 coin to obtain the agency right; from that moment on, for every subsequent earning from this artifact, the agent will receive 70%, and you, as the original creator, will receive 30%.

If you don't make a setting, it defaults to be "Disallowed" and prevents users from participating in managing your work.

### Owner Contract

You can also transfer an artifact and all its rights and interests as a whole package at a total price. Who acquires it becomes the new owner of this artifact, possessing all future rights and interests. (This is equivalent to setting the profit-sharing ratio of the agency contract to 100%, completely transferring the artifact to the new owner.)

Please note, Babelyx highly values the worth of originality. Even if you completely transfer the original work to a new rights holder, you still, and will forever, possess the sole original creator identity for this artifact, i.e., the Creator.

If you don't make a setting, it defaults to be "Disallowed" and prevents users from acquiring your work and its rights.
