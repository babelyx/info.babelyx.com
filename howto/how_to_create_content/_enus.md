### Form of Creations

Every creation consists of three optional parts:

- **Title** : A title. Optional. Fully public.
- **Cover** : An image. Optional. Fully public.
- **Content** : A story. Optional. Encrypted protection! Content can include multiple paragraphs; each paragraph can be in various forms such as text, images, videos, files, etc. Therefore, you can tell a complete and rich story within the content, such as serialized novels, photography, market research reports, professional experience sharing, and more.

Each of these parts can be omitted. This means you can publish a creation with just a sentence, just an image, or just a standalone story.

The **title** and **cover** are completely public, accessible to anyone, just like on the traditional internet. Therefore, you should only include information in the title or cover that you want to be public.

**Content** is the core part of your artifacts, sealed with Bitcoin-level encryption, protecting your rights and permanently belonging to you. No individual or institution will have the ability to peek, copy, alter, or use it without your authorization.

### Content Restrictions

Babele itself does not impose any restrictions on content!

You only need to adhere to the rules of other sources, such as:

- Complying with speech restrictions in your region. You cannot post content that conflicts with the laws of your area.
- Respecting copyright. You shall not publish or use content that might violate other's copyright.
- Following community etiquette. You must not negatively impact or harm other users.

On this basis, you can:

- Cite links from other platforms. No problem! Babelyx follows the spirit of the original open internet.
- Post commercial-related content. No problem! Babelyx is happy to be valuable and helpful to you.
- Communicate with other users privately. No problem! Babelyx is not a closed community, but an open world that unleashes your possibilities instead of suppressing your potential.

### Smart Trading Contracts

Every artifact contains intrinsic Smart Contracts to enable automatic trading and generate a continuous stream of income for you! See [How to Monetize Creations](../monetize_creation/_enus.md).
