We hope to explore the new possibilities and new value of artificial intelligence with more partners.

To this end, we have developed and launched the Community Rewards Program. Bring more interested partners together.

We have built the technical infrastructure to promote and build your own AI customer base.

Let's explore together and share the new value of the AI industry~

## 1. Individual and business partners

You can invite your friends to come and play together. Your invitation code is a coupon!

#### The invitation code is a coupon!

All new users will receive a trial credit of 100 œµ (worth $1).

New users who sign up at your invitation will also receive an additional 400 œµ (worth $4) coupons!

Therefore, your invitation code itself is worth about $4, and you can sell it at a discount or even give it away for free in any way.

#### Gift invitation, hand fragrance

For each new user you invite, you will receive a 50 œµ bonus (worth $0.5), which will be issued after real-name authentication or first payment.

#### Exclusive community, long-term cashback

All the users you invite form your exclusive community, and the amount you spend each month will be cashed back to you the following month.

You can build your own community in any way you are good at: live streaming, social circles, chat groups,......, inviting more new users.

#### remark

The specific rules of the above community partnership program may change from time to time over time. Stay tuned for the latest announcements.
