### Babelyx: From User Content To User Values

2025-05-13

Babelyx is the Web3 Library of Babel, the metaverse of user-generated content. It engraves user content artifacts onto Web3 media (using blockchain, smart contracts, IPFS, NFT, and more innovative technologies), encrypting, storing, and trading them, thereby unlocking every possibility for everyone.

In Babelyx, users can:

- Simply publish a sentence or an image, just like on Web2 social media, to record life and share daily moments.
- Meticulously create long-form or high-value content artifacts from professionals, teams, and institutions.
- Based on the unique properties of Web3 technology, even high-value user content can be minted into artifacts with physical properties—immutable, non-replicable, and unforgeable—thus enabling the sale, circulation, and appreciation of everyone's content artifacts, just like on an e-commerce platform!

### The Library of Babel: Metaverse of Artifacts

2025-05-12

Artifacts are either predominantly physical or predominantly psychological in nature. The combinations of the 118 physical elements are endless, and so are the symbolic combinations of words, colors, shapes and musical notes.

> In 1941, Nobel laureate Julio Cortázar wrote a novel, "**The Library of Babel**," proposing a magical concept. The Library of Babel is a simple yet infinite library containing all possible combinations of letters. In this library, no matter where one stands and looks around, there are infinitely extending walls of books, composed of countless hexagonal bookshelves. Any two adjacent books on each shelf differ by only a single letter. Despite this simple, minute difference, if you walk far enough along the book walls and navigate enough turns, you are bound to find any book you desire. In this boundless library, all combinations of all languages, all subjects, and all meanings are contained, including every possibility of the past, present, and future.

The Library of Babel is the metaverse of all possibilities. Most combinations are meaningless, only a small fraction among them are useful and meaningful. In particular, all user-generated content (UGC) are meaningful artifacts. Every time we speak, take a photo, or post on social media, we are creating a piece of the library of Babel.

If we engrave user-generated content onto stone or some other medium, it becomes a painting, a book, a record, or a movie.

If we publish user-generated content on the Web2 internet, it becomes social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok.

If we engrave user-generated content onto Web3, what possibilities will it foster? That becomes Babelyx!

### Artifacts and Creators

2025-05-11

Novels, paintings, music, mathematical formulas—from grand scriptures like Buddhist sutras, the Bible, and the Quran, to any casual remark we utter—are all "artifacts," just like pots, pans, buildings, airplanes, and mobile phones. Some artifacts seem to be composed entirely of the 118 physical elements, yet they possess shapes, styles, and meanings that can only be described by a textual metaverse. Some artifacts seem purely illusory, but behind all illusions, there must be physical traces.

A lost ancient text must be inscribed on some **parchment** buried underground. A folk song never written down must have vibrated through generations of throats and rippled through waves of sound. A chat sticker that disappears after being viewed must have altered the electromagnetic field on some computer. A question posed to artificial intelligence must have triggered an electrical wave disturbance and inference in an artificial neural network; and you, too, must have experienced a momentary or even lifelong surge of brainwaves and neuronal storage in your mind. Even if all of the above vanish into the river of time, the process of their dissipation must have left other traces.

> In the 2010 novel "Death's End" (The Three-Body Problem III): Luo Ji raised his staff high above his head, his white hair and long beard flowing, looking like Moses parting the Red Sea, and solemnly cried, "Carve the words onto stone!"

Humanity transcends animals because it created an illusory textual metaverse, which in turn acts upon the physical universe. All textual descriptions are illusions, but based on these illusions, humans have constructed nations, countries, companies, morals, laws, capital, and skyscrapers. Even if an illusion vanishes with the blink of an eye or a power outage, once it has appeared, it proclaims its eternal existence. The only question is how to record it more permanently: personal memory, oral tradition, murals, **parchment**, paper, local computer hard drives, internet remote servers, decentralized IPFS.

> In the 2010 movie "Inception," once an idea is planted in a person's mind, it can never be eradicated; it can only be guided through layers of dreams to find an outlet.

Every time we arrange flowers, tighten screws, or when we speak, take photos, even when we are thinking or dreaming, we are creating artifacts. Everyone is a creator.

### Words are Humanity's First Metaverse

2025-05-10

Everything expressed in words—family, religion, country, love, hate... — is not composed of the 118 physical elements of the universe but exists only in imagination. Humanity wove the illusory first metaverse with words, guiding the construction of today's world. Therefore, the moment humans first created writing, it was recorded as an event that "startled heaven and earth, maked ghosts and gods weep."

> The anthropological classic "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" points out that human society is "imagined reality based on fantacy". Humans live in a "dual reality" - the objective reality of rivers and trees, and the imagined reality of gods and nations.

In 2019, Meta proposed the metaverse, which became a sensation, but five years later, it faded away amidst huge losses. Meta's metaverse was merely a virtual sensory world, a rather superficial concept, but it intuitively pointed to the essence of what distinguishes humans from animals: a "metaverse" transcending the material.

What will the second metaverse be? It shall possess power comparable to that of words, once again "startling heaven and earth, making ghosts and gods weep." Just as words elevated humans from animals to Homo sapiens, it will once again elevate humanity - or some other species, maybe AI - to a realm we cannot even imagine today.
