Since the beginning of this year, a new Web3 concept has been grabbing attention everywhere: RWA, or Real-World Assets. This involves converting traditional assets, such as real estate or company stocks, into tokens that can circulate on the blockchain, significantly enhancing the liquidity and value discovery of these real assets.

However, I believe that general RWA is difficult because real-world assets are non-standardized and require countless offline services for customization. Yet, certain specific categories of RWA, like the recent tokenization of U.S. stocks by Robinhood, represent a very good business model, though there are still many legal obstacles to overcome.

Besides real-world assets, why not first try "virtual world assets"? Similarly, virtual world assets have countless non-standardized possibilities, but they can also be simplified into a specific category, such as user-generated content assets! This is exactly what Babel is doing.

Bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain requires addressing the technical and legal gaps between offline and online. Therefore, only already digitized assets, like company stocks, are suitable for RWA on the blockchain.

In contrast, virtual assets are already online, so there’s no need to overcome technical and legal barriers again.
