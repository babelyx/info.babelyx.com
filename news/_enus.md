### Fuel over Like (2025-05-30)

Users can now "fuel" their favorite creations by paying a minimum of 1 cent, replacing the ordinary "like" feature.

We made this change to encourage users to support creators and their works, rather than just liking them. This is a small step towards building a more sustainable ecosystem for content creators.

Support for German and Japanese languages has been added.
