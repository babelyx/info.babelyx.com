# Babelyx: From User Content To User Values

🌎 [简体中文](./_zhcn.md)

Babelyx is the Web3 Library of Babel, the metaverse of user-generated content. It engraves user content artifacts onto Web3 media (using blockchain, smart contracts, IPFS, NFT, and more innovative technologies), encrypting, storing, and trading them, thereby unlocking every possibility for everyone.

In Babelyx, users can:

- Simply publish a sentence or an image, just like on Web2 social media, to record life and share daily moments.
- Meticulously create long-form or high-value content artifacts from professionals, teams, and institutions.
- Based on the unique properties of Web3 technology, even high-value user content can be minted into artifacts with physical properties—immutable, non-replicable, and unforgeable—thus enabling the sale, circulation, and appreciation of everyone's content artifacts, just like on an e-commerce platform!
