Artifacts are either predominantly physical or predominantly psychological in nature. The combinations of the 118 physical elements are endless, and so are the symbolic combinations of words, colors, shapes and musical notes.

> In 1941, Nobel laureate Julio Cort√°zar wrote a novel, "**The Library of Babel**," proposing a magical concept. The Library of Babel is a simple yet infinite library containing all possible combinations of letters. In this library, no matter where one stands and looks around, there are infinitely extending walls of books, composed of countless hexagonal bookshelves. Any two adjacent books on each shelf differ by only a single letter. Despite this simple, minute difference, if you walk far enough along the book walls and navigate enough turns, you are bound to find any book you desire. In this boundless library, all combinations of all languages, all subjects, and all meanings are contained, including every possibility of the past, present, and future.

The Library of Babel is the metaverse of all possible artifacts. Most combinations are meaningless, only a small fraction among them are useful and meaningful. In particular, all user-generated content (UGC) consists of meaningful artifacts. Every time we speak, take a photo, or post on social media, we are creating artifacts.

If we engrave user-generated content onto stone or some other medium, it becomes a painting, a book, a record, or a movie.

If we publish user-generated content on the Web2 internet, it becomes social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok.

If we engrave user-generated content onto Web3, what possibilities will it foster? That becomes Babelyx!
